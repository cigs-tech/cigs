My mom calls it lodash for making ai functions. Others call it graphql for functions. Anyways, cigs are composable intelligent generative snippets that give you new ways to build powerful apps making use of the latest in ai

What it does:

* Call typescript methods with natural language and get response back in specified structure (ie, call the same function and
* Chain multiple Ai functions together to build complex workflows
* Helper functions for common tasks like classification, extraction, tool execution, and generation

Sounds weird, but with some examples it might make more sense

## Future Direction & Todos

I want to make this a full framework for building ai apps. Here are some things I want to add:

* Support for multiple ai providers
* Support for more modalities (ie, image, audio, video)
* Complex interactions (ie, chatbots, agents, etc)
* Easy way to deploy, manage and monitor cigs
